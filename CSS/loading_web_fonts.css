/* Use the @media screen designator to keep Outlook from trying to load web fonts. Skipping this can result in Outlook ignoring a large part of your styling. */

/* You can replace the @font-face details with any Google font you wish. While other fonts can be used, using Google fonts give you numerous options, good optimization, and high reliability. Here's a simple method to get the actual font-face elements from the Google fonts CSS:

1. Navigate to fonts.google.com
2. Select a font family (and add it with +)
3. Open the dialogue box at the bottom and select 'Embed'
4. Copy the url from the embed code and paste it into the search bar
5. A page will load full of font-face elements
6. Simply copy and paste the 'latin' element
7. You'll need to do this for each font (and font-weight) you'd like to include

Now you can call your Google font like any other font in your stack, in this case font-family: 'Poppins' */
